# Java 19 Features

1. Virtual Threads (Preview)

       Virtual Threads, part of Project Loom, are lightweight threads that aim to simplify 
       concurrent programming by making it easier to scale applications with many threads.
2. Structured Concurrency (Incubator)

       Structured Concurrency aims to simplify multi-threaded programming by treating
       group of tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work.
3. Pattern Matching for switch (Third Preview)

         Pattern Matching for switch enhances the switch statement and expression with pattern matching capabilities, 
         making it more powerful and expressive.
4. Foreign Function & Memory API (Second Preview)

       The Foreign Function & Memory API allows Java programs to interoperate with 
       ode and data outside the JVM, particularly native code.
5. Vector API (Fourth Incubator)

       The Vector API provides a mechanism to express vector computations that compile to optimal 
       vector hardware instructions on supported CPU architectures.
6. Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators

       This feature enhances the java.util.random package with new interfaces and implementations 
       for pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), including jumpable PRNGs and streamable PRNGs.
7. JEP 405: Record Patterns (Preview)

       enhancing pattern matching capabilities by allowing patterns to match on record types directly.
       This feature simplifies and makes code involving records more expressive and concise.
