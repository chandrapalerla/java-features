# Java 11 Features

API Enhancements and New Features:

1. HTTP Client (Standard) API:

   The java.net.http package introduces a new HTTP Client API to replace the old HttpURLConnection API. 
   This new API supports both synchronous and asynchronous programming models.

2. Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters:

   You can now use the var keyword to declare the types of the parameters in implicitly typed lambda expressions.

3. Nested Based Access Control:

   **Benefits of Nested-Based Access Control**
   **Simplified Access:** Nested classes can access private members of their enclosing class more directly.
   **Elimination of Synthetic Methods:** Reduces the number of synthetic methods generated by the compiler, leading to cleaner bytecode.
   **Improved Performance:** Reduces the overhead associated with accessing private members via synthetic methods.
   **Better Error Messages:** Eliminates confusing error messages related to synthetic methods.

4. Optional.isEmpty():

5. String Methods:

      New methods in the String class: lines(), strip(), stripLeading(), stripTrailing(), repeat(int), and isBlank().

6. Files.readString() and Files.writeString():

Memory Management and Performance Improvements:

1.	ZGC (Z Garbage Collector):
      A scalable low-latency garbage collector designed for applications requiring large heaps with low pause times.
      To use ZGC, start the JVM with the -XX:+UseZGC option.

2.	Epsilon Garbage Collector:
      A no-op garbage collector that handles memory allocation but does not reclaim memory. Useful for performance testing and memory pressure testing.
      To use Epsilon GC, start the JVM with the -XX:+UseEpsilonGC option.

3.	Heap Allocation on Alternative Memory Devices:
      Support for heap allocation on non-volatile memory (NVM) devices.

4.	Dynamic Class-File Constants (JEP 309):
      Allows the JVM to load and process constant pool entries at runtime, enabling more dynamic and flexible constant handling.

5.	Flight Recorder:
      java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a tool for collecting diagnostic and profiling data about a running Java application with low overhead.
      It can be enabled with the -XX:StartFlightRecording option.

Deprecations and Removals:

1.	Removal of Java EE and CORBA Modules:
      The Java EE (javax.xml.bind, javax.xml.ws, etc.) and CORBA modules were removed from the JDK.
2.	Nashorn JavaScript Engine Deprecated:
      The Nashorn JavaScript engine has been deprecated in favor of other JavaScript engines like GraalVM.
3.	Pack200 Tools and API Deprecated:
      The pack200 and unpack200 tools and their associated APIs have been deprecated.
