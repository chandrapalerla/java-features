# Java 20 Features

1. Pattern Matching for switch (Fourth Preview)

        This feature enhances the switch statement and expression with pattern matching, 
        allowing for more concise and readable code when dealing with complex data types.
2. Record Patterns (Second Preview)

       Record patterns extend pattern matching to deconstruct record values, making it easier to work with data classes.
3. Scoped Values (Incubator)

       Scoped values provide a way to share data within a limited scope, 
       useful for managing context-specific information in concurrent programs.
4. Virtual Threads (Second Preview)

       Virtual threads aim to provide lightweight threads that can scale with the hardware, making it easier to write
       and maintain concurrent applications.
5. Foreign Function & Memory API (Second Preview)

       This API facilitates calling native code and manipulating native memory, 
       providing better performance and control.
6. Vector API (Sixth Incubator)

       The Vector API provides a mechanism to express vector computations that can be optimized at runtime, 
       improving performance for data-parallel operations.
7. Structured Concurrency (Second Incubator)

       introduces a new API to simplify concurrent programming by treating multiple tasks running 
       in different threads as a single unit of work. This approach helps to improve reliability and observability
